Form Validation Project 
* This project demonstrates a basic form validation system using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Project Structure:
* index.html: The main HTML file containing the form with input fields and validation output.
* style.css: The CSS file styling the form and its elements.
* script.js: The JavaScript file responsible for handling the validation logic.
  
Functionality:
* The user fills out the form with required information.
* On submission, the script checks the input fields for validity using regular expressions and other validation rules.
* If all fields are valid, the form is submitted successfully.
* If any field is invalid, the user sees error messages indicating what needs to be corrected.
  
Features:
* Basic Validation: The script currently checks for required fields, valid email addresses, and valid phone numbers.
* Visual Feedback: The form elements change color and display messages to guide the user.
* Clear Instructions: The form includes helpful labels and placeholder text.
